Item 3 - Guideline 2.1 - In-app purchase info
  1. Who are the users that will use the paid content and subscriptions in the app?
    - Anyone who wants to continue to use all the app features after the 3-day trial period ends.
    - There is no subscription. The user pays once for the Pro version of the app.
  2. Where can users purchase the content and subscriptions that can be accessed in the app?
    - From the app drawer, tap "Purchase Pro version". This uses Apple's in-app purchase system.
  3. What specific types of previously purchased content and subscriptions can a user access in the app?
    - They can see the details of the markers collected in the app, after the 3-day trial period ends.
  4. What paid content, subscriptions, or features are unlocked within your app that do not use in-app purchase?
    - All other features are available without in-app purchase.

Item 4 - Guideline 2.3.8 - Accurate Metadata - App name
   - App UI is now updated to correctly reflect app name.

Item 5 - Guideline 2.5.4 - Software Requirements
   - Demo video now shows functionality.
   - User must tap "play" to start the background tracking, otherwise the tracking only works when the app is in the foreground.
   - This is also documented for the user by tapping the "how to use this app" button in the app drawer.
